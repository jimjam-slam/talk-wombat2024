# What's scrollytelling?

# Why is scrollytelling hard to do well?

I'm currently at CounterCurrent, helping ships save less fuel

But I worked as a data journalist at Monash

Quarto made it super fast

(transition from why I love Quarto)

## Quarto has made regular web pages easy for data people

- (compare plain knitted HTML to Quarto)

## Engineering required for scrollytelling

- Detecting whether things are on screen
- Transitions
- Sizing and positioning content

- Data journalism teams split this into engineering, design and data journalism
- Previous single-person solutions were commercial (eg. ESRI)

# Enter Closeread

- Goal: make scrollytelling accessible to people familiar with Quarto
- Goal: reasonable defaults with powerful options
- Other goals
- Design implications
  
# Closeread Contest

- [We're running another contest!](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/contests/data-scrollytelling) Closes Dec 20

# What's on the horizon

## Widget support

- Contest entries that tried to use htmlwidgets
- htmlwidgets, Jupyter widgets, ...

## Video support

- Videos that play when they enter
- Can be used for mood setting, interviews
